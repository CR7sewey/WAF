## WAF - Wanna be a Footballer

### Aim

The aim of this app is to provide a plataform for amateur football players to find games near their
town or region, and also to have a profile as a footballer. Each stat will be registered per game,
and with time an overall status of each player will be presented, based on statistics, games played,
and also which players has he/she faced.
